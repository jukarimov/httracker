 Tracking utility for hikers

httracker is a jquery powered on top of web server,
running on maemo with python-location packege installed, ugh :X

== Simple steps:

* Calibrate map
* Start http server
* Run gps.py
* Navigate to httracker/src (using microb)
* Track yourself now (8-)

Happy hiking ;)
